### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Joe Donlan and I'm an aspiring Data Engineer based in York, UK!

A PhD-trained scientist and experienced technical communicator, Iâ€™m kick-starting a new career in back- end development and data engineering. Iâ€™ve long been fascinated by systems and how they are designed, and Iâ€™ve seen up-close the immense value that data can provide to businesses when it is used to its full potential. Back-end and data engineering neatly combine these interests, a realisation which motivated me to switch careers in 2023. The Data Engineering bootcamp at [https://northcoders.com](Northcoders)has equipped me with strong technical foundations to complement my expert communication and analytical skills, and Iâ€™m excited to start applying these skills in my first role!

You can find my ongoing projects pinned below, and download a copy of my latest CV [here](JosephDonlan_CV_Nov2023.pdf).
