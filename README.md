### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Joe Donlan and I'm an aspiring Data Engineer based in York, UK!

A PhD-trained scientist and experienced technical communicator, Iâ€™m kick-starting a new career in data
engineering. Iâ€™ve long been fascinated by systems and how they are designed, and Iâ€™ve seen up-close the
immense value that data can provide to businesses when it is used to its full potential. Data engineering
neatly combines both of these interests, a realisation which motivated me to switch careers in 2023.
The Data Engineering bootcamp at Northcoders has equipped me with strong technical foundations to
complement my expert communication and analytical skills, and Iâ€™m excited to start applying these skills
in my first role!
